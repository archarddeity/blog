                Have you ever got that feeling? When you are scrolling continuously and being entertained by various nonsense posts, videos and so on. And I was like..
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>What the.. I spent 10 minutes of my life watching 2 people building a pool by barehands and acting like an evolve monkey? And just making random noises?</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                It's just an example, there are a lot of videos out there that is really weird nowadays. Even in YouTube shorts, it is like you are curious what it is, then all of the sudden, you spent a lot of time watching it. Is it like a temptation to see witness something start and finish in just a quick pace. Piling up all the shorts that you watched, it still equates to a large amount of time, right? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh well, why do I say this. I am watching anime and the temptation and curiousity is being fed by that.
