                Sometimes, I remember that I never wanted to become a Producer. When I learned how to play Bass Guitar, I studied the notes on fret boards and was confused why Acoustic and Electric Guitars had more complicated chords when I only get the basic notes with flats or sharps. <br><br>

So I only got interested and passionate with how guitars are being played, I learned how to play chords, pluck strings and strum. It was that time when YouTube became a thing, so I searched for Guitar videos, and I stumbled on a video mafe by "Socci and Pency", there was a song they made that I really liked. At that moment, as YouTube recommended me new musicians that is related to my searches, I happened to watch and was fascinated with a Guitarist, named <i>Sungha Jung</>. Watching him play made me sink deeper into learning more about Acoustic Guitars; I learned Flamenco Strumming, Acoustic Harmonics, Open Guitar Tunings, Percussive Playing and more that is related to Acoustic Guitar playing. He also linked me to various Guitarists that inspired me, including Ulli BÃ¶gershausen, Thomas Leeb, Jerry C and Niel Zaza.<br><br>

Now, what really changed my course of music was when I heard <i>The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus</i>, it was my first favorite foreign band, since their songs are very progressive, melodic and catchy. I remember hearing Electric Guitars in Distortion and Overdrive Effects before, I thought Electric Guitars are the ones capable of doing that, turns out, it wasn't.<br><br>

Hearing this type of music gave me comfort for some reason, it was until I discovered new Guitarists that gave my Guitar journey a further roadmap. They were, Charlie Parra Del Riego, Erock, Stevie Terreberry, Jerry C, Niel Zaza, Funtwo, Michael Mac, Mattrach and Eddie Van Halen. I learned a lot of techniques from them including: Speed picking, tremolo picking, tapping, alternate tapping, shredding, sweep picking, power chords, alernate picking, fast picking and a lot more. A whole new concept opened to me, it was at this time I really focused on scales and refining my own Guitar sound.<br><br>

Everything went well from there.. I even added more guitarists, to be specific, the Guitarists of Emo bands, like Pierce The Veil, Black Veil Brides, Blessthefall, Asking Alexandria and a lot more bands on the same spectrum. I also liked Guitarists on old gold bands like, Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Blue Oyster Cult, The Beatles, and a lot more that I can't remember.<br><br>

Well, I told my whole Guitarist story at this length of blog, so I am just going to say why I became a Producer. <br><br>

There are points of my life where I tried forming a band, long story short.. I haven't really formed a band that is connected with my musical style. So I figured, maybe I just need to focus on one particular genre, so the band would work, well.. that advice didn't really went well with me, so I just gave up on making bands since my music is more of a mixed variety that I believed only I would find enjoyable, then I saw this Music Producer, his name is Shady Cicada. From there, I just figured out the answer to my problem.<br><br>

<i>I just need to make myself as the musician of the whole thing, no problem, I know how to play Guitar, so other musical instruments would be similar in some ways... Hopefully.. Okay, I think they would be similar in tempo and by the basic theory, it's just that, I need to practice how to execute them seperately and accordingly.. No pressure.. I think..</i><br><br>

And this is what happened to me. Bruh.
